## Component Features Enabled by APIs:

1. **Real-time Shipment Data**: Fetches live shipment data from backend
2. **Status Filtering**: Can filter shipments by status (processing, in-transit, delivered, delayed, cancelled)
3. **Refresh Functionality**: Individual shipment refresh and bulk refresh
4. **Detailed View**: Modal with comprehensive shipment details
5. **Status Updates**: Ability to update shipment status (admin feature)
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to mock data when APIs fail
7. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during API calls

## API Client Integration:

The component uses the centralized `apiClient` utility which provides:
- Consistent error handling
- Type-safe responses
- Automatic token management
- Request/response logging
- Standardized response format

## Error Handling Strategy:

1. **Network Errors**: Fallback to mock data
2. **API Failures**: Log error and show mock data with warning
3. **Individual Operation Errors**: Show error message but maintain functionality
4. **Loading States**: Show appropriate loading indicators

## Backend Dependencies:

All APIs require the following backend endpoints to be implemented:
- `GET /api/v1/shipments/active` - Get active shipments
- `GET /api/v1/shipments/{id}` - Get shipment details
- `PATCH /api/v1/shipments/{id}/status` - Update shipment status
- `GET /api/v1/shipments` - Get all shipments with filters
- `GET /api/v1/shipments/analytics` - Get shipment analytics

## Authentication:

All API calls include authentication headers:
- Bearer token from cookies
- Authorization header support
- Fallback to x-access-token header

## Next Steps for Enhancement:

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
2. **Tracking History**: API to fetch shipment tracking history
3. **Geolocation**: APIs for shipment location tracking
4. **Notifications**: Alert system for status changes
5. **Bulk Operations**: APIs for bulk status updates
6. **Export**: APIs for shipment data export (CSV, PDF)
